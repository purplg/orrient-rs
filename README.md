## Usage

### Controls

- `n` to add a new item to applicable list, for example, tracks.
- `/` to search an applicable list, for example, achievements.

### Tracking items

In the achievements tab, you can search for an achievement you want to search by using the `/` key and `space` to start tracking that item. These items will appear in the _Tracks_ tab.

On the Tracks tab, you can remove an item by pressing `Space` again on it. (Eventually there will be a confirmation box to prevent accidental removable). To add a custom item by press `n` on this tab.
